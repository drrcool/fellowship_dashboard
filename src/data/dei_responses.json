[{"region": "Global", "summary": "**LGBTQ Representation and Experience**  \nA prominent theme emerging from the feedback relates to the significant representation of LGBTQ individuals, particularly gay men, in CMA meetings, resulting in a sense of exclusion for those outside this demographic.

NA is inclusive, so are a couple of AA meetings.\"  \n- \"We are 99% gay men in the Berlin meetings.\"  \n- \"We are not readily available for those outside the lgbtqia community.\"\n\n**Racial and Ethnic Diversity Concerns**  \nResponses highlight a lack of racial and ethnic diversity, especially noting an overwhelming presence of white individuals which may not reflect broader community demographics. This had led to feelings of marginalization among people of color who feel underrepresented or unwelcomed.  \n- \"The only reason why I stayed in Cma Chicago was so I could be the change I needed as a newcomer. There were times fellows were directly or indirectly racist.\"  \n- \"It is not available in in most areas of color and communities that need the resource the most.\"  \n- \"Predominantly gay in LA.\"\n\n**Accessibility and Inclusivity Issues**  \nAnother significant concern is the physical and social accessibility of meetings. Many responses indicated that meetings are not friendly to people with disabilities or are generally unwelcoming to straight people or those who are bisexual. Moreover, issues around cliquish behavior and exclusivity in social interactions were highlighted, alienating newcomers or less integrated individuals.  \n- \"Meetings are NOT AT ALL disabled friendly.\"  \n- \"Huge gap between LGBT and straight communities. Neither will meet the other half way.\"  \n- \"There's a pretty tight clique that runs the show so if you're not in with them, it's not very inclusive.\"\n\n**Gender Representation**  \nSeveral responses pointed to a disproportionate number of men in attendance, particularly noting an underrepresentation of women, both cisgender and transgender. This skew in gender balance poses challenges in creating a welcoming environment for all genders.  \n- \"No women.\"  \n- \"Female attendance seems to be lacking.

Could use more sexual and racial diversity.\"\n\n**Geographic and Meeting Availability**  \nFeedback suggests a lack of meetings in certain regions, impacting accessibility for those who might benefit from CMA's support but find no local options. This geographic limitation is especially noted in less urban areas or particular states where respondents feel isolated from support networks.  \n- \"There's NOTHING HERE in Washington State for Meth addicts.\"  \n- \"I still have yet to find a meeting within my own area.\"  \n- \"No meetings in Belgium.\"\n\nThese themes encapsulate critical areas where improvements could be considered to enhance the inclusivity, accessibility, and appeal of CMA meetings to a broader cross-section of the community."}, {"region": "Pacific", "summary": "**Theme: Predominance of Gay Men in Meetings**\nMany respondents noted that CMA meetings tend to be predominantly attended by gay men, particularly in urban areas like San Francisco and Los Angeles.
