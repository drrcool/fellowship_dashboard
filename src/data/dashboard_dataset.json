This philosophy and policy making process is a precursor to communism and bureaucratic elitism and a danger to those it claims to help (minorities, vulnerable populations etc.) because it creates a culture of mediocrity.  We already have traditions that protect diversity and equity.  I am sad to see CMA focusing so much on outside issues when the real issue is an inside problem.  It is creating more and more division within our fellowship.","what_see_more":"More adherence to the traditions of AA, which is what CMA is appropriating and trying to change to fit their own needs.  I think the new NYCMA 12 step text is ok...i feel it is a dumbed down version of the 12 steps, and should only be used as a supplement to the Big Book.  Yes the Big Book uses language that is historical, and was written during a time when progress towards equality was still being fought for (it is still being fought for today).  Does that mean we shouldn't study a historical text because its too difficult to understand?  No, we should be elevating newcomers to learn and expand their minds and knowledge, and teaching them acceptance and critical thinking in recovery, instead of just simplifying everything down to an elementary level so that its \"easier\" for them to understand.  Historically, thousands of people have learned to read for the first time through studying the Big Book.  I used to hate the big book.  But once I finally accepted that I don't know everything and that I may actually get something useful from a text I use to disagree with so strongly, I realized that there is so much useful information there and there is no reason for me to change everything around me, I need to change what is inside me.  That being said, yes, I definitely do not know everything, and if someone wants to use the new CMA 12 step guide and it works for them that is great and I am happy for them to recover, but I do have the opinion that it should be used as a supplement, not the main source, of recovery literature.    You know what would be nice, to see NYCMA members and old timers actually welcome new people to the fellowship that aren't sterotypically \"hot\" or \"desirable\" as gay men.  I see so many newcomers ignored in meetings, and had the same experience myself when I came to NYCMA, because NYCMA is an extremely cold and cliquey fellowship of gay men that have lost contact with the true purpose of 12 step program which is to lift up the still suffering addict and welcome them warmly to the fellowship regardless of their \"desirability\".  That is the real problem of (NY)CMA.  If we want \"equity\", we need to start talking to the new people that walk in the door and welcome them and offer sponsorship and love them.  We can't legislate that, its an action individuals must learn to take.

A focus on balanced living, the ability to form intimate relationships, engage in recreational activities, and discover joyful hobbies is essential.    We cannot rely solely on The Steps and service for long-term recovery, and top doctors and scientists are now discovering this.    In our Area Intergroup, we struggle to cover our service positions and suffer from a \"too-much-work-not-enough-play\" culture. This has been the case for as long as I can remember, and it seems to breed resentment.    Over my 16 years, I have observed a pattern. One or two driven members, who, in my humble opinion, resemble \"bleeding deacons,\" emerge. These well-meaning but non-experienced individuals ascend to service positions of leadership and become \"the glue\" who keeps everything together. Ultimately, this is a failing proposition as it always ends up creating a toxic culture.    Over the years, the preceding has been my primary frustration with CMA as an organization.    Perhaps I can summarize by recommending more \"fellowship\" related inspiration within and around CMA. Doing this, along with supporting Areas in streamlining their service structure, will go a long way to inspire our membership through \"good balanced living\" as a fundamental philosophy.    I respectfully submit my opinion in full recognition of \"the few\" people who strive every day beyond their means to keep CMA alive and growing. CMA is at an age and development level that demands that we espouse balanced, modern, and progressive living to our members, especially our members of service.","city":"Denver","region":"Colorado","country":"US","cma_region":"Southwest","state":"Colorado"},{"gender":"Male","ethnicity":"Caucasian","age":"45-54","sexual_orientation":"Gay","drugs_used":["Methamphetamine","GHB"],"attending_other_fellowships":["AA","NA"],"negatively_affected":["Employment \/ Career","Housing \/ Residence","Family Relationships","Committed intimate relationships","Legal","Financial","Physical \/ Mental health and well being"],"positively_affected":["Employment \/ Career","Housing \/ Residence","Committed intimate relationships","Legal","Financial","Physical \/ Mental health and well being"],"current_meeting_attendance":"2 -

But I miss CMA. There\u2019s nothing like a good meeting with other meth addicts in recovery. However, 7 pm at lambda is just too late for me. I get up at 4 to make the gym and the morning meeting. If there were a 5 pm meeting once a week I would add it into my schedule (as long as I didn\u2019t have class). On occasion I make the 12:30 pm on Sunday at the pride center, but I still miss u guys!

I have over two years of sobriety but I am a disabled veteran and I unemployed and I don\u2019t own a car. So for myself I feel out of place at many of the LGBTQ CMA meetings. I am enrolled in college and will be completing my associates degree this academic quarter and that might make me feel a little bit more equal to others in the Rooms","what_see_more":"I would like to see more sensitivity shown to disabled veterans like myself. I am 54 years old and I don\u2019t feel like I have a voice at many of the meetings. I am in college earning an associates degree as well as a Certificate in Addiction counseling and I have a wonderful relationship with my instructors and other students. Yet in CMA I feel ignored and overlooked by many of the people there even though I have done service work and all the things people are expected to do in a 12-Step environment. I want to support CMA in Portland and I want to see CMA succeed which is why I am excited that Portland was chosen to host the 2025 General Service Conference, at the same time the fellowship needs to be more supportive of me. Our fellowship hardly does any fellowshipping and I have written about this before. True, we do have some events but mostly we just get on a bus, go to meetings do service work and then get back on the bus and go home and repeat endlessly. It seems like Portland\u2019s recovery community has never recovered from the pandemic in that respect. Plenty of people attend CMA meetings but otherwise our community is fragmented into small social groups and cliques. We don\u2019t spend enough time with each other outside of the meeting environment and get to know each other better.These are just my thoughts in my humble opinion.

We also sadly see predatory action between gay men to other gay men.  Sadly this has often been brushed aside, or members will say \"that sucks, but I don't think we should police behavior and ask people to leave if they are acting like this\".  I would love to see CMA be more protective of it's members as an expectation. Our common welfare comes first and sometimes that means asking someone to leave a meeting and setting expectations for their behavior when they return.","city":"San Jose","region":"California","country":"US","cma_region":"Pacific","state":"California"},{"gender":"Female","ethnicity":"Caucasian","age":"35-44","sexual_orientation":"Heterosexual or straight","drugs_used":["Methamphetamine","Opiates"],"attending_other_fellowships":["None"],"negatively_affected":["Employment \/ Career","Family Relationships","Committed intimate relationships","Legal","Financial","Physical \/ Mental health and well being","other"],"positively_affected":["Other"],"current_meeting_attendance":"Do not attend meetings","felt_welcomed":"Don't recall","introduction_to_cma":["CMA Website \/ Literature"],"education":"Trade School","employment_status":"Self employed","months_years_clean":["0 to 6 months"],"relapse_part_of_story":"Yes","twelve_step_sponsor":"No","currently_working_steps":"Looking to begin working the steps","have_homegroup":"Still looking for a CMA Homegroup","ever_been_incarcerated":"Yes","access_to_meetings_incarcerated":"No","residential_treatment_experience":"Yes","cma_meetings_in_residential":"No","dei_feelings":"No","dei_freeform":"There are none in South Carolina ","what_see_more":"I am a beginner looking for help.

However, it's not uncommon to hear someone say \"we as gay men\" or in other ways assume that everyone is gay. I can say with pretty much certainty that there are very view straight people and very few cis females in the NYC fellowship.  ","what_see_more":"More CMA literature. I know it's coming the Step Book from NYCMA is a great contribution. Different meeting formats are nice and there some of that happening in NYC. There is a new meeting where it's only speakers and no sharing.","city":"New York City","region":"New York","country":"US","cma_region":"Mid-Atlantic","state":"New York"},{"gender":"Male","ethnicity":"Caucasian","age":"55-64","sexual_orientation":"Gay","drugs_used":["Methamphetamine","Poppers or other inhalants"],"attending_other_fellowships":["AA"],"negatively_affected":["Employment \/ Career","Family Relationships","Committed intimate relationships","Legal","Physical \/ Mental health and well being"],"positively_affected":["Employment \/ Career","Committed intimate relationships","Physical \/ Mental health and well being"],"current_meeting_attendance":"Daily","felt_welcomed":"Welcomed","introduction_to_cma":["Therapist Referral","Other"],"education":"College 4-Year Degree","employment_status":"Employed part time","months_years_clean":["3 - 5 years"],"relapse_part_of_story":"Yes","twelve_step_sponsor":"Yes","currently_working_steps":"Yes","have_homegroup":"Yes","ever_been_incarcerated":"No","access_to_meetings_incarcerated":null,"residential_treatment_experience":"No","cma_meetings_in_residential":null,"dei_feelings":"Yes","dei_freeform":null,"what_see_more":"More literature.

I feel the Portland CMA Community could benefit from more fellowship and more socializing outside of the meeting environment. Our CMA community is primarily made up of gay or queer white men though we do have some people of color (POC) and others who identify as lesbian, nonbinary, or transgender but very few. Along with the LGBTQIA+ AA meetings our CMA community which partnered up with AA used to have picnics, potlucks BBQs, bowling, movie events, and much more. Now the pattern that I see, and experience is I get on a bus, go to a meeting, and when the meeting is over get on a bus and return home. Others take their car back and forth and sometimes I get a ride from another member. Even when people take time with 1 or more years the pattern is to go to a meeting get our chips or coin then go home. No one wants to go out to eat afterward or bring treats to the meetings. I am grateful for my sponsor who takes me and his other sponsees out for Sunday brunch or dinners when we have annual sobriety milestones and other times just for fun. During the winter holidays, I am never invited to do anything with anyone from CMA or the AA folks either so I have spent my holidays with people outside of the program or alone and I am fine with that, but I know that the holiday season can be a hard time for some people and that relapses increase during that time.  To be fair, Our CMA Community does have official CMA events once per month such as hikes, speaker meetings, and even a movie event last year. I also recognize and appreciate that we do have a few individuals who work hard and are committed to CMA on the Area level, but they are just a handful of folks. However, it would be nice if people said, \u201cHey let\u2019s go see a movie after the meeting\u201d, especially one that is popular with people in The Rooms. Our community in general needs to get out of the Pandemic era \u201cmalaise\u201d that has plagued Portland for so long and start socializing more and doing fun things more often.   Portland has citywide recovery events such as the Oregon Recovers Walk4Recovery event in September and Hands Across the Bridge that was in August, yet these events were barely announced in our CMA meetings. In each case, people who are active in CMA or have been in the past attend these recovery events in small groups or are involved in the organizations that plan and host them. I post notices for these events on a nonaffiliated CMA group on social media and send out emails BCC-ing recipients to notify them of upcoming recovery events however I never receive much if any feedback. There are opportunities for CMA, even if unofficially, to be more involved with recovery events and happenings in the Portland Metro Area and elsewhere in Oregon and I would like to see more members in my community take an active role.  For myself, I seem well-liked by my peers, and I see that care, but I have grown tired of getting on a bus, sitting in a meeting for 60 to 75 minutes then getting back on the same bus and going home. I am in college and have been taking courses so that I can obtain both an associate degree in general studies and a certificate in Addiction Studies I then plan to transfer next year to a four-year university, and I am being exposed to the greater recovery community of Portland. I have sentimental feelings for our CMA community, and I do like the people who attend the meetings. I just wish we could get to know each other outside of the meeting environment. These are just my thoughts in my humble opinion. Thank you for your attention.

For instance if you have an event in a heavily populated area and 350 people show up to the event you think oh we really carried the message to 350 people, however, the caveat is if you bring the same event to a rural area and it brings 100 people from that rural area you're creating more of a diverse message with a longer reach to those that are usually more prone to exclusion, not to just those that are already involved in a heavily populated area.

Some kind of written folkloric(?) collection of all the regional group traditions that existed before Covid-era, geographic mixing in virtual meetings diluted them - things like weird names for chip colors (Ur-ine for a new life. Tiffany blue for a new you), cheers, joining in at certain points in the readings (e.g., \u201cno matter what\u201d), etc, A hankie color \/ fabric for people in recovery.
